## For something more serious, get organized?

1. Be in control of your assets
2. Know where to find what
3. Avoid unmanageable pile of files, as your project grows bigger
4. Scale easily
5. Easy maintenance
6. etc.

In short, don't waste your time cleaning the garbage off your desk, when you could very well use that time for doing something more productive. Get organized now, to save time and effort later.
